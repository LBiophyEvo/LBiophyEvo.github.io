 abstract = {The segmented RNA genome of influenza A viruses (IAVs) enables viral evolution through genetic reassortment after multiple IAVs coinfect the same cell, leading to viruses harboring combinations of eight genomic segments from distinct parental viruses. Existing data indicate that reassortant genotypes are not equiprobable; however, the low throughput of available virology techniques does not allow quantitative analysis. Here, we have developed a high-throughput single-cell droplet microfluidic system allowing encapsulation of IAV-infected cells, each cell being infected by a single progeny virion resulting from a coinfection process. Customized barcoded primers for targeted viral RNA sequencing enabled the analysis of 18,422 viral genotypes resulting from coinfection with two circulating human H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 IAVs. Results were highly reproducible, confirmed that genetic reassortment is far from …},

 abstract = {Enzyme design is an important application of computational protein design (CPD). It can benefit enormously from the additional chemistries provided by noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). These can be incorporated into an ‘expanded’ genetic code, and introduced in vivo into target proteins. The key step for genetic code expansion is to engineer an aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (aaRS) and an associated tRNA that handles the ncAA. Experimental directed evolution has been successfully used to engineer aaRSs and incorporate over 200 ncAAs into expanded codes. But directed evolution has severe limits, and is not yet applicable to noncanonical AA backbones. CPD can help address several of its limitations, and has begun to be applied to this problem. We review efforts to redesign aaRSs, studies that designed new proteins and functionalities with the help of ncAAs, and some of the method …},

 abstract = {Amino acids (AAs) with a noncanonical backbone would be a valuable tool for protein engineering, enabling new structural motifs and building blocks. To incorporate them into an expanded genetic code, the first, key step is to obtain an appropriate aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetase. Currently, directed evolution is not available to optimize AAs with noncanonical backbones, since an appropriate selective pressure has not been discovered. Computational protein design (CPD) is an alternative. We used a new CPD method to redesign MetRS and increase its activity towards β‐Met, which has an extra backbone methylene. The new method considered a few active site positions for design and used a Monte Carlo exploration of the corresponding sequence space. During the exploration, a bias energy was adaptively learned, such that the free energy landscape of the apo enzyme was flattened. Enzyme variants could then …},

 abstract = {Mechanistic models of genetic interactions are rarely feasible due to a lack of information and computational challenges. Alternatively, machine learning (ML) approaches may predict gene interactions if provided with enough data but they lack interpretability. Here, we propose an ML approach for interpretable genotype-fitness mapping, the Direct-Latent Interpretable Model (D-LIM). The neural network is built on a strong hypothesis: mutations in different genes cause independent effects in phenotypes, which then interact via non-linear relationships to determine fitness. D-LIM predicts genotype-fitness maps for combinations of mutations in multiple genes with state-of-the-art accuracy, showing the validity of the hypothesis in the case of a deep mutational scanning in a metabolic pathway. The hypothesis-driven structure of D-LIM offers interpretable features reminiscent of mechanistic models: the inference of phenotypes, fitness extrapolation outside of the data domain, and enhanced prediction in low-data regimes by the integration of prior knowledge.},

 abstract = {The fitness of organisms depends critically on regulatory strategies that balance multiple phenotypes, including physiological, developmental, and pathogenic. An important example is the trade-off between motility and growth determine competition for habitat colonization by microorganisms and the invasiveness of metastatic cells in cancer. Phenotype regulation relies on hierarchical gene networks, but how gene hierarchy contributes to adaptation remains unclear. Here, we show that global upstream regulators allow cells to adjust the impact of downstream local regulators in the context of a phenotypic trade-off. We performed single and double knockdowns of transcription factors in Escherichia Coli and measured their impact on swimming and growth in different environments. We observed that perturbations of local regulators affect only a specific phenotype independently of the genetic background, whereas perturbations of global regulators affect either one or both phenotypes to varying degrees depending on the genetic background. Global and local regulators strongly interact giving rise to sign, reciprocal sign and masking epistasis. Epistasis between particular genes is modulated by the environment, but only a restricted number of epistatic patterns are observed across environments. These epistatic constraints suggests that that local regulators should be typically acquired before tuning of the phenotypic trade-off by global regulators. These findings highlight the importance of pleiotropic regulators for coordinating phenotypic responses to complex environments and providing flexibility during evolution.},
