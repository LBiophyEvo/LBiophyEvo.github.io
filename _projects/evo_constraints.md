Cellular activity relies on thousands of genes organized in networks of
functional interactions. On one hand, gene networks are shaped by evolution. On
the other hand evolution is constrained by the structure of gene networks. We
aim to uncover the interplay between gene networks and evolution from the
mechanistic level. For instance, given genes that interact in a metabolic
pathway or regulate each other, do certain mutations alter the effect of each
other on a phenotype (a phenomenon referred to as epistasis)? Until recently, we
have focused on detailed experimental studies on well-characterized gene
networks of small size, interpreted in the light of theoretical models of
biochemical interactions. We are currently expanding the scope and generality of
our approach at the cellular scale. For this, we develop strategies to measure
rich phenotypes (e.g. transcriptomes, fitness) in a large number of variants of
microorganisms using microfluidics and sequencing. We also study how mechanistic
models can be combined with machine learning or data resulting from
high-throughput screens.
