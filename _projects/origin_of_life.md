Autocatalysis underlies self-reproduction in chemical and biological systems.
Autocatalysis is known to occur in various chemistries (small molecules,
biopolymers) but we still lack a general understanding of it. We have recently
shown the existence of stoichiometric motifs universal to all autocatalytic
reaction networks. From this basis, we aim to systematically characterize
autocatalysis in chemistry, thus uncovering the diversity of natural metabolisms
and design artificial ones.
