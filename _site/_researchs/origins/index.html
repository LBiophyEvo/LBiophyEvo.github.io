<p>Evolution is the major driving force of biological complexity, but evolution is
in itself a complex process that does not seem likely to appear in a spontaneous
manner. Thus, how evolution can emerge from purely physical-chemical processes
remains a fundamental puzzle. We study this question in in vitro RNA reaction
networks capable of self-reproduction. The first step is to understand how the
Darwinian properties of variation, reproduction with heredity, and selection can
be implemented from molecular mechanisms. We notably investigate the role of
recombination as a driving molecular mechanism. Evolution further requires its
different properties to work in concert. This must rely on a form of a
compartmentalized life cycle. Indeed, each compartment provides a unit of
selection for collectives of molecules and natural selection operates on
populations of such compartments across generations. To create and analyze
compartments, we make use of droplet microfluidic technologies (in collaboration
with Andrew Griffiths, Laboratory of Biochemistry ESPCI) and self-assembled
compartments (in collaboration with Tommaso Fraccia, SAM team).</p>
